							   Each person who donates blood completes a simply physical examination and short blood test before giving blood.

								As a result, it is possible that a person could identify unknown health concerns as a part of the blood donation process. These health issues could include blood pressure concerns or low blood counts.

								A person should never use donating blood to find out if they have any blood-borne diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Instead, they should always go to their doctor with any concerns they have.

								Although low blood counts would stop a person from donating, discovering this information could help them pursue more information about their health.

							Most people experience at least mild versions of these side effects.
							If you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous after the rest period part of your donation, lie down with your feet up until you begin to feel better. Call your blood donation center if you continue to experience these symptoms several hours after you’ve made your donation.

						When you donate blood, you sit or lie on a reclining chair with your arm extended on an armrest. A healthcare provider will place a blood pressure cuff or tourniquet around your upper arm to fill your veins with more blood. After cleaning the skin on the inside of one of your elbows, the provider will insert a sterile needle attached to a thin plastic tube and blood bag into one of your veins. The needle is kept in your arm for about 10 minutes, or for the duration of your blood donation.

When a needle pricks a vein, there’s always a chance that some bruising will occur around the site where the needle was inserted. For that reason, bruising is common among blood donors.

Bruises range in color from yellow to blue to purple. Mild to moderate bruising is usually not something to worry about. If you experience bruising, apply a cold pack to the bruised area every few hours for several minutes during the first 24 hours after you donate blood.

			<h2>How does blood donation work?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>If a person is considering being a blood donor, it is important that they understand the steps involved in the process.</p>
			<br>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6" >
					<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Before donating, people must register for donation, complete a medical history, and have a mini-physical examination.
						These steps help ensure that a person has not been exposed to diseases that could be spread to others by blood donations.
						The tests also reveal if someone is not a good candidate for giving blood due to personal health concerns.
						Examples of these issues include low hemoglobin levels or high or low blood pressure.

					<h3>During the Donation</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="text-justify">
						The donor's arm is cleaned with an alcohol prep pad, and a member of the donation team inserts a needle into a vein. The needle is brand-new and sterile.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">The needle is attached to a collection tubing and bag, and the blood will flow into the bag until it is full.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">According to the American Red Cross, a whole blood donation takes 8-10 minutes on average. If a person is donating a blood product, such as platelets or plasma, this process can take up to 2 hours.

				<div class="col-md-6 mt-3">
					<h3>After the Donation</h3>
					<br>
					<p class="text-justify">
						When a person has finished donating blood, medical personnel will remove the needle or
						intravenous catheter, apply pressure with a cotton gauze, and place a bandage over the
						person's arm.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">The donor will usually wait for 10-15 minutes before leaving, during 
					which time they will be encouraged to eat and drink some refreshments.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">Donated blood can only last for a certain time 
					and must be used before it expires. As a result, blood banks and hospitals 
					have almost a continuous need for donated blood.
